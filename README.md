# Real-time Chat Application

Designed and developed a full-stack chat application using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

Implemented user profile creation, real-time multi-user chat, image sharing features, and integrated read receipt functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.
The frontend code is intended to create a web application with authentication and a chat feature. Users can set their usernames, and upon successful authentication, they can access a chat interface. It utilizes React for building the user interface and Axios for making HTTP requests. The project is styled using CSS for an attractive and responsive design.

The backend part of my project includes a Node.js server that handles user authentication by interacting with a Chat Engine API. I configured middleware for handling JSON requests and enabling CORS. This server registers users on a Chat Engine API by making a PUT request with the provided "username" and handles errors using Axios.I structured the project's backend using Express and Nodemon is used for development convenience.
